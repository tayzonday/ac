		<p>Alright,</p>
		<p>I just don't get it. Why are most people willing to admit that racism still goes on in businesses and most parts of life, but when it comes to sexism, people (especially men) get really pissed off and say that it still doesn't go on in businesses and society, even though it clearly does? </p>
		<p>As soon as guys enter any female-designated area of work (nursing, secretary, ect) the wages paid to that area increase. Because suddenly the job is more "difficult, and deserving of more money". And hell, even at my parents businesses even though the women are doing the more difficult work on storage, organization, planning, ect and had to go to post secondary in order to get the jobs, they are getting paid $2 less than the no-post secondary education guys that shove stuff into driers all day. And 15 years ago, these women were getting some really serious harassment from the other men. Furthermore, just recently more guys entered into the formerly-girl only area of the workforce, and almost immediately the wages went up for all the women in the area.</p>
		<p>It's retarded.</p>
